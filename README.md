## 🔐 Password Samples and Evaluation

| Password | Strength | Suggestions | Estimated Crack Time |
|----------|----------|-------------|-----------------------|
| 12345 | Very Weak | Too short, numeric only | <1 second |
| Deepika123 | Weak | Common pattern, includes name | <1 second |
| D33p!K@_2606 | Strong | Good mix of symbols, upper/lowercase | 2 years (approx.) |
| G#7pT!Xr@920&Kz | Very Strong | Excellent length and randomness | Billions of years |
| flaggers_united@2025 | Very Strong | Long passphrase with symbols | Trillions of years |

## ✅ Tips for Creating Strong Passwords
- Use **at least 12–16 characters**
- Mix **uppercase**, **lowercase**, **numbers**, and **symbols**
- Avoid using personal information (names, birthdays)
- Consider using **passphrases** (e.g., `Monkey@Sky_Walks_2030`)
- Change passwords periodically and **do not reuse**

## 🔍 Common Password Attacks

### 🔸 Brute Force Attack
Attempts every possible combination of characters until it cracks the password. Strong, long passwords resist this better.

### 🔸 Dictionary Attack
Uses a list of common passwords or words to guess the password quickly. Avoid dictionary words to defend against this.

### 🔸 Credential Stuffing
Uses leaked credentials from one service to try logging into others. Solution: never reuse passwords.

---

## 🛡 Role of Password Managers
- Generate and store complex passwords securely
- Autofill credentials, reducing the risk of reuse
- Examples: Bitwarden, LastPass, 1Password

## 🔑 What is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)?
MFA adds a second layer of security (OTP, biometric, etc.) in addition to your password, making it harder for attackers to breach even if they guess your password.
